"# modeline" 
mode|line (aka modeline)

# about|
This package aims to build an all purpose model pipeline in one package. Work flow of model building often involves extensive data cleaning and data investigations all the way to model tuning. All of which require fairly standardised outputs such as summary and diagnostic tables & charts. mode|line functionises these processes so one can focus on the more value-adding tasks such as adhoc data investigations and feature creation. Another highlight of mode|line is the production of well formated, automated reports ready to be used without further editing.

# components|
